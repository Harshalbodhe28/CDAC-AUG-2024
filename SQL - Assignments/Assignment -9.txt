#1) Pairs of Salespeople Living in the Same City
#To get pairs of salespeople who live in the same city, excluding combinations of the same salesperson and duplicate rows, you can use a self-join:

SELECT 
    s1.Sname AS salesperson_1, 
    s2.Sname AS salesperson_2,
    s1.City
FROM 
    salespeople s1
JOIN 
    salespeople s2 ON s1.City = s2.City
WHERE 
    s1.Snum < s2.Snum;  -- Ensure no duplicates and exclude self-pairing
#2) Customers with the Same Rating as Hoffman
#To find customers with the same rating as "Hoffman," you'll first need to determine Hoffmanâ€™s rating and then find customers with that rating:


SELECT 
    c.Cname, 
    c.city
FROM 
    customers c
JOIN 
    (SELECT Rating 
     FROM customers 
     WHERE Cname = 'Hoffman') AS hoffman_rating 
ON 
    c.rating = hoffman_rating.Rating;
