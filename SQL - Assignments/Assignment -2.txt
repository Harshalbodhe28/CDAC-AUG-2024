4. Why isnâ€™t it possible to see the first five rows of a table?

Answer: This statement is incorrect. It is generally possible to see the first five rows of a table using SQL query statements. For example, in most database systems, you can use the SELECT statement with a LIMIT clause to specify the number of rows to retrieve.

For instance, to see the first five rows of the CUSTOMERS table, you could use the following query:


SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS LIMIT 5;

This would display the first five rows of the table.

If you are unable to see the first five rows, it might be due to:

Access restrictions: You might not have the necessary permissions to view the table's data.
Data volume: If the table contains a very large number of rows, it might take longer to load the initial data.
Database configuration: There might be specific settings or configurations in your database that are preventing you from viewing the data.
